        <h2><center>About Me</center></h2>
        <p>My name is Chris Ireland and I am currently a Senior studying Construction management at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/" target="_blank">Colorado State University</a>. I was born and raised in Golden, Colorado. Growing up I played soccer, baseball, tennis, and I swam. I graduated from Regis Jesuit High School in 2016 in which I learned many things and gained lasting friendships. One of the things that caught my intrest in school was video editing. I loved being able to create things that others could take enjoyment of. Below is one of the videos that I made in high school.</p>

        <p>Skiing is also a big part in my life right. I grew up skiing with my dad until he hurt his back. I wasn't able to go skiing again until high school when I could drive myself. I have since fallen in love with skiing. One goal I have in life is to travel and ski all over the world. Still being able to ski was one of the big factors when I was choosing where to go to college. I decided on CSU and it is one of the best decisions of my life. I have loved every minute of my time here at CSU. I came into college undecided on what I wanted to study. I found a passion in Construction Management and I am glad that I did. As my time here at CSU comes to a close I am excited to experience what the future holds for me and all of the crazy adventures that willl take place. </p>
